    <h2>Tips for renting a car in Skopje</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>There are requirements you must meet to rent a car in Skopje. You must provide a current driver's license and a valid ID card or passport. All drivers must have had their licenses for at least a year. If you have a driving license from an EU member state or your license is in Latin characters, you do not need an International Driving Permit (IDP). You may have to provide a valid IDP for other nations and a national driving license. Your car rental provider may require an identification card, passport, credit card, or any other paperwork, so be sure to confirm its requirements.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The A1 and A2 highways are toll roads that connect Skopje to other regions of the country. There are no tag transponders on these roads. Instead, you pay toll fees at actual toll gates, with cash or a credit card. Cash payments must be in either euros or Macedonian denars. Make sure you have enough money to pay the tolls at the gates before starting out in your Skopje car rental.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make sure your Skopje rental car has a booster seat for any child in the car. Boosters are for kids between ages 6 and 7 who weigh between 33 and 79 lbs. Install an infant seat facing backward if you want to travel with an infant up to age 1 and weighing less than 20 lbs. These seats support the baby's spine, neck, and back. Also, make sure you install a reversible seat in the back seat of the car if your child is between the ages of 1 and 5 and weighs between 20 and 42 lbs.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While Skopje is well-connected via bus, it is truly best traversed in a private vehicle. This is partly because buses are often much slower and less direct than simply driving on your own. Additionally, having your own car allows you to see and experience the character of Skopje and its surrounding areas for yourself. Say, for example, you want to head out to one of Skopje's neighboring sights like Matka Canyon. It is just a 16-kilometer (10-mile) trip from Skopje and only takes 30 minutes to reach in a car.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For travelers looking to rent a vehicle and who are arriving in Skopje via Skopje International Airport, the rental car counters can be found in the Arrivals Hall of the main terminal. Renting a car at the airport is likely the most convenient option available for visitors.</li>
        <br>
        <li>One law to keep in mind when driving in Skopje and throughout Macedonia is that you are legally required to keep your headlights on when driving at all times, including during daylight hours. If you happen to forget, there is a good chance that other drivers will flash their lights at you to remind you to turn yours on.</li>
